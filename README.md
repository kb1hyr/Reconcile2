# Reconcile2
Used as part of the SPG project to make sure the billing system (Broadhub),
Clearcable (setting up SPG) and NOMS (the actual provisioning system) all
agree on which subscriber modems should be provisioned.  This puts out a 
number of CSV files easily imported into Excel to find these errors so they
can be fixed before SPG is installed.
